The dice rolling is done following the Legend of the Five Rings (4th ed) roll and keep system and includes exploding dice, skill emphasis and the Ten Dice Rule.

The example is designed to show the effects of messing with rolled and kept dice numbers on your average and how an emphasis changes things. It is not intended to be used as an in-game dice roller as it takes an average over many, many rolls. The underlying library could be used in a game if desired.

The visualisation is done using jqplot, which can be found here:
